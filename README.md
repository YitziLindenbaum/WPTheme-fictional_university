This repository holds the code for the Udemy course "Becoming a Wordpress Developer".

The root folder ("fictional-university-theme") should be placed at "app\public\wp-content\themes" (if using a website generated by Local -- I believe the path should be the same or similar if using another method of holding a Wordpress site).
